        <h1>Hi, I'm Marty Smith!</h1>
        <p>I'm a software engineer in Columbia, South Carolina.</p>
        <p>I enjoy writing code that's clean, intuitive, modular, and utilizes creative solutions for efficient data processing and storage.</p>
        <p>My favorite projects involve finding innovative software solutions to technical challenges in science and industry.</p>

      <h2>About Marty</h2>
      <p>Like a chef who knows that proper measurements are no substitute for good taste and a sharp palette, I'm a full stack developer who applies a great deal of customization and attention to even the most minute detail to my projects.  No two builds are the same nor are the needs of two different clients, and I take great pride in producing outstanding, innovative work for all my creations.  In addition to my work as a developer, I've spent significant time in the automotive and biotech industries.  My formal education is in Public Health and Integrative Biology.</p>
      <p>Programming is a team sport and I'm always looking for new collaborators, projects, and opportunities.  If you'd like to work with me so we can grow our skills as a team or you'd like to add my talents to your organization don't hesitate to reach out to me.  I'm also available to your organization as a consultant and actively seeking volunteer opportunities for causes I believe in.</p>
      <p>Technologies I'm proficient with include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript ES6+ — Node.js/Express.js/EJS — React — Next.js — jQuery — MongoDB — PostgreSQL — Python/Django</li>
        <li>Full-Stack Architecture including MEN & MERN</li>
        <li>Bootstrap — Materialize UI — Tailwinds</li>
        <li>Version control via CLI with Git</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I believe strongly in the importance of key design principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designs which are accessible, intuitive, and force santized user input.</li>
        <li>Code which is clean, modular, DRY, and reusable.</li>
        <li>Extensive documentation of code both inline and in reference materials (eg, README files).</li>
        <li>UIs which are highly-functional yet minimalist in design.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When not locked in front of my computer working on a project, I can be found enjoying a good movie, taking the trailer on a camping trip with my family, barbecuing a pork shoulder in my back yard, or complaining to the TV about the New York Rangers' power play.  I prefer my steak rare, take my gin with tonic and rosemary, and will accept a meatball cookoff challenge from anyone.  My favorite homes away from home are New Orleans and Cape Cod.</p>

          <p class="top-pg-lower">Description: Every developer consults the Google for troubleshooting code, but most sources where users share and compare code snippets are designed around sharing code which is broken, non-functioning, or in other ways problemative.  ScriptStud.io is a website by and for developers to document, save, and share examples of well-written functional code.  This was a collaborative project </p>
          <p>Technical Details: This is a full MERN-stack application and its construction was and continues to be a collaborative effort between myself and fellow developer <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-mosley/' target=”_blank”>Christian Mosley</a>.  This app features React extensions for JS code processing and syntax highlighting as well as rendering on the front-end.</p>

In a process where a young professional might only accept a position after hundreds of applications, Job Hound is an application to keep the process organized.  A young professional hunting for a job can use it to log vital data about positions and companies they've applied to and track follow-up activity on those applications.</p>
          <p>Technical Details:  This full-stack application was built as a MEN-stack as an effort to make a project with entirely server-side processing.  It secures users' data by using Google OAuth.  This project was developed individually by myself.</p>

The live app, currently presented as a client-side interface, features intuitive and accessible design which is easy to use and forces santized user input.  So Quiz Me!</p>
          <p>Technical Details: This project is a work in progress and is currently built with a jQuery front-end (linked) and a Django back-end.  Originally a project for General Assembly, I was rather deep into the project when I learned that Django does not natively support DOM manipulation.  I'm currently refactoring the Django back-end to work with a front-end I created as an earlier jQuery project, which itself I'm refactoring as a React front-end.</p>
