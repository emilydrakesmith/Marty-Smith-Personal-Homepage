# Marty-Smith-Personal-Homepage
My personal homepage.  Welcome!

This is the first webpage I ever built and as such it consists of static HTML, CSS, and no scripts whatsoever.  In the future I plan to completely rebuild this content into a 2.0 version with either `Next.js` or `Gatsby`, but until I have the time it will remain a static HTML page.

# Version Notes

The version of my website currently live is 1.0.3.  In cases where I update the README without any updates to the website itself I do not update the version number or use branches for my work.  Each version number will lack a commit number until the next version is uploaded.  The commit number is always added retroactively as it's generated at the time that I commit the project to the host.  In general, for version number format X.Y.Z:
* X: increases in this number represent a complete overhaul of some section of the website or source code
* Y: increases in this number represent a major functional change/aesthetic change to the website
* Z: increases in this number represent changes that are relatively minor but still warrant a new commit

Please note that I have made significant updates to how I record version notes since the initial build of this website in September 2020.  Version notes for commits prior to May 2021 were largely build from limited information available via `git log` and are not comprehensive.

# Future Plans
### Major
* Rebuild website from the ground up, likely using Gatsby.
* Utilize a dark scheme with higher-contract color choices.

### Minor
* Alter `.git` repo to use a `main` rather than a `master` branch.
* Wrap text around & below an image as screen size changes.
* Replace social media text links with graphics.
* I can clean up the CSS a lot by using more `div` containers and `id` attribute tags.
* Make different sections of the website switch to desktop variants at different widths.
* Lock the header section when scrolling.
* Left-justify text for portfolio items which are picture-right.
