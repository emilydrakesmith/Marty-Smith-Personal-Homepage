Imported open-source font 'Manrope' from Google APIs.

# Version Notes

v1.1 --IN PROGRESS--  This version will reformate the site layout using Flexbox and a mobile-first design.
  -- Added `"initial-scale=1"` to HEAD for better scaling on different devices.

  -- Updated page title to include 'Software Engineer'.
  -- Added page-section navigation links to `<header>`.

# Future Goals

  -- Wrap text around & below an image as screen size changes.
  -- Replace social media text links with graphics.
  -- I can clean up the CSS a lot by using more div containers and id tags.
  -- Make different sections of the website switch to desktop variants at different widths.

# Update Log

9/25 I now have v1.1 mostly complete.  Content and formatting are done.  Now it's time to make tweaks to
     spacing, check for typographical errors, etc.

9/24 Cleared out most of the content from index.html (HEAD retained) and from style.css; I have separate copies
     which I'll work from to redevelop the contents of both.

9/24 Downloaded repo from https://github.com/mhsmith321/Marty-Smith-Personal-Homepage.  Initializing as v1.01.
