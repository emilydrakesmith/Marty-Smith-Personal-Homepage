# Version Notes

The version of my website currently live is 1.1.0.  In cases where I update the README without any updates to the website itself I do not update the version number or use branches for my work.  Each version number will lack a commit number until the next version is uploaded.  The commit number is always added retroactively as it's generated at the time that I commit the project to the host.  In general, for version number format X.Y.Z:
* X: increases in this number represent a complete overhaul of some section of the website or source code
* Y: increases in this number represent a major functional change/aesthetic change to the website
* Z: increases in this number represent changes that are relatively minor but still warrant a new commit 

**v1.1.1**
* Added some structure to placeholder text in the 'Portfolio' section.
* Moved CSS formatting from the Google Maps iframe to the `style.css` file.
* Added significantly more content to the README file.

**v1.1.0 commit 13b3b1950e2d2fb59460520dc6511d0f10941ed6**

* Updated page title to include 'Software Engineer'.
* Added page-section navigation links to `<header>`.

* Added a contact form to 'Contact' section.
* Added Google Maps Columbia, SC to 'Contact' section.

# Tech Framework

**This app uses:**
* HTML5 and CSS
* JavaScript ES6

**I built this app using:**
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.49.2
* Chrome 85 (for display and DevTools)
* [Git-Bash](https://git-scm.com/) 2.28.0.1
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) (online portal, not desktop)
* Windows 10 Pro v1909

**This app is stored at:**
* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mhsmith321/Marty-Smith-Personal-Homepage)
* Primary Domain: https://martysmith.tech/
* Other domains I control: https://martysmith.dev/
                           https://martysmith.io/
                           https://martysmith.cloud/
                           https://martysmith.co/

For an easy time reading the code files I recommend using a code viewer that wraps at no less than 160 characters.

# Future Plans
* Wrap text around & below an image as screen size changes.
* Replace social media text links with graphics.
* I can clean up the CSS a lot by using more div containers and id tags.
* Make different sections of the website switch to desktop variants at different widths.
* Lock the header section when scrolling.

# Contribute

Although I'm always interested in meeting new collaborators I prefer to keep this an individual project as a skills demonstrator.

I'm happy to let anyone reuse my code so long as you contact me for advance permission and give attribution where appropriate.
